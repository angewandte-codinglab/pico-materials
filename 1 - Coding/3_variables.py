# variables are used to assign a value to a label
# a varible can then be used repeatedly in your code

# varibles have the following syntax
# label = value
name = 'Uli'

# this is a number variable
age = 27

# text can be in single or double quotes
fullname = "Ulrich" 

# a number also be written as a string 
year = '2024'

# but only numbers can be used for calculation
print(age + 1)

# if we use add text together, it will be joined
print(name + ' is ' + age)
